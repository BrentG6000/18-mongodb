# 18-mongodb

## Description

This web app simulates the backend of a social media app. It uses a mongodb database to store user information including posts (thoughts) and comments (reactions). This
program can be used by a front end site to create a social media app. By creating this app, I learned how to use a mongodb database to store data using models.

## Installation

To install this app simply download the code from this repo, open a terminal and run "npm i" in the root downloaded folder to install the needed node modules (you must have node installed on your system
to do this). Then run "npm run start" to begin the program.

## Usage

This app only uses a database with no frontend, so you should use a program like Insomnia or Postman to add, update, or delete database entries.
